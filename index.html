<h1><u>Welcome to RebootWorld</u></h1>

<h3>Reboot</h3>
<p>Reboot server is different from other servers in Maplestory in which you:
<ul><li>Cannot trade with other players</li>
<li>Cannot scroll items</li>
<li>Is highly dependent on mesos</li>
</ul>
<p>You also cannot "trade" with yourself as in most items cannot be transferred between characters through storage. Please be aware that even though some items state that it can be moved between accounts/characters <b>NO EQUIPMENT ITEM CAN BE TRANSFERRED</b>. In exception to this are some USE items, ETC items, SET-UP items and the occasional cash transfer event (more on this in FAQ)</p>
<h4>So why should you play on Reboot server?</h4>
<p>People find the trait of not having to pay real money to get stronger appealing, taking away the "pay2win" factor from the game. In exchange, instead of spending money to get stronger, in Reboot it's about how much time you spend playing the game.</p>
<h4>What does that mean?</h4>
<p>It means instead of spending real money, you spend mesos to get stronger, the in-game currency system. This is due to the increase in droprate of mesos in Reboot. So it is important to earn/farm mesos in Reboot hence, how much time you spend will equal how strong you will get.</p>
<h4>COME PLAY</h4>
<p>So, if you are looking to get strong really fast by throwing your wallet at it then Reboot isn't for you, however if you are looking for a chill server, don't mind the grinding, or just a poor college student come to Reboot and have some banter and meet some henehoes.</p>
